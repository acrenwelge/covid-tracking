I created this site to track coronavirus cases. It uses [this API](https://covidtracking.com/api)
to fetch data and populate charts that are rendered with [chart.js](http://chartjs.org/).

Regression modelling is done with [this open source JavaScript regression library](https://github.com/Tom-Alexander/regression-js).
I use it to fit a curve to the data and allow future projections based on the chosen model.
